After running the following commands:

```
npm install -g remake
remake create remake-test-app
cd remake-test-app
```

You'll have a working Trello clone application!

To get it running locally, use the command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server.

Finally, look in the "app" directory to see what a full Remake web app looks like.

Of particular note is the file "username.hbs" in the directory `/app/pages`. That's where ALL the Remake logic for the Trello clone lives.

Follow the instructions in `/app/START_IN_THIS_DIRECTORY.md` to start creating a Remake app from scratch.

I promise this will be easier to get started with in the future.

Good luck and have fun building!
